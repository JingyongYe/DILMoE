## Why Do We Need DynMoE?

Sparse MoE (SMoE) has an unavoidable drawback: *the performance of SMoE heavily relies on the choice of hyper-parameters, such as the number of activated experts per token (top-k) and the number of experts.*

Also, *identifying the optimal hyper-parameter without a sufficient number of ablation studies is challenging.* As the size of the models continues to grow, this limitation could result in a significant waste of computational resources, and in turn, could hinder the efficiency of training MoE-based models in practice.

Now, our **DynMoE** addresses these challenges through the two components introduced in [Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DynMoE)](#dynamic-mixture-of-experts-dynmoe).

## Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DynMoE)

## Top-Any Gating

![hh](./assets/moe-overview.gif)

We first introduce a novel gating method that enables each token to **automatically determine the number of experts to activate**.

## Adaptive Training Process

![adaptive-training](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/QAQdev/Pics@master/uPic/adaptive.png)

Our method also includes an adaptive process **automatically adjusts the number of experts** during training.

## Can We Trust DynMoE? Yes!

- On language tasks, **DynMoE surpasses the average performance among various MoE settings.**
- **Effectiveness of DynMoE remains consistent** in both Vision and Vision-Language tasks.
- Although sparsity is not enforced in DynMoE, it **maintains efficiency by activating even less parameters!**

##  Directory Specification

### Experiment Code

- `EMoE/` contains experiments on language and vision tasks, which uses tutel-based DynMoE.
- `MoE-LLaVA/` contains experiments on language-vision tasks, which uses deepspeed-0.9.5-based DynMoE.

### DynMoE Implementations

- `Deepspeed/` provides DynMoE-Deepspeed implementation.
- `EMoE/tutel/` provides DynMoE-Tutel implementation.

## Environment Setup

Please refer to instructions under `EMoE/` and `MoE-LLaVA`.

## Usage

### Tutel Examples

Please refer to `EMoE/Language/README.md` and `EMoE/Language/Vision.md`.

### DeepSpeed Examples

Network Configuration

```python
deepspeed.moe.layer.MoE(
  hidden_size=84,
  expert=fc3,
  num_experts=n_e // 2,
  ep_size=args.ep_world_size,
  use_residual=args.mlp_type == "residual",
  k=-1, # -1 means using DynMoE
  min_capacity=args.min_capacity,
  noisy_gate_policy=args.noisy_gate_policy,
  max_expert_num=n_e
)
```

Training model forward, you can control the adaptive process by using `if_begin_record_routing`, `if_end_record_routing`.

```python
outputs = model_engine(inputs, if_begin_record_routing=True, if_end_record_routing=True)
```
